              I hope you've enjoyed going through my demo blog! Let's get introductions over: I'm Xuanson. I am still studying Computer Science and I am an aspiring web developer!
              I really could go on more and more, but you can find all of that on my <a href="www.xuansonon.com">website</a>, where you can find more of my other projects and works.
              Anyway, I'm sure you're not reading the developer's notes for the sake of learning about me personally, so below I explain this project.
            </p>
            <p>
              This food blog project was originally not intended for continuation or maintence. It wasn't even supposed to be food theme (but everyone likes food), but I had to find
              a topic in which can reflect the design of the site. Of course, it could be used as a blog about economics, sports, etc. It was orignally designed to be a universally themed
              blog. The only reason for this site to be food-theme was because of the images, backgrounds and the topics that were chosen.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's get to the building blocks of the site: I built the design and structure purely in HTML and CSS. Alongside these markup languages, I also used AngularJS to power the blogging
              side of things (or to be <em>really</em> specific, the back-end). AngularJS allows users to dynamically power their site using the Model View Controller (MVC) approach. The MVC
              approach follows the design principles in which functionality are sperate to design. If it weren't for AngularJS, this site would not be a blog site at all. Of course, I could've
              used PHP and MySQL to get posts, but AngularJS is what makes this site dynamic.
            </p>
            <p>
              I went for a simple, elegant and minilistic design. The home page consists of three sections, the navigation, the content and the footer. These three sections are at the maximum
              width of 960 pixels (the go-to resolution for a lot of sites). Similarly to this page, the sections have a white background, and behind it is a simple wallpaper that is positioned
              statically on the view. I felt that using a white background for the whole site, especially with a small content area (of 960 pixels) would not be appealing. I also found a wallpaper
              that was not distracting and yet appealing and enough to constrast the white background of the contents.
            </p>

              More notes coming soon as I prepare it and proof read for publishing...
            </p>
            <p>
              I would really like to take the time now to say a very big thank you to a few mentionable names. I've used 3 author's food posts to populate the site with posts, and two artists
              photos I've used for my wallpapers and feature images:
